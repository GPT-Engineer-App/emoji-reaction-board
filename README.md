# emoji-reaction-board

for an "Public Post Board" app, that should:
- allow users to create accounts
- allow logged in users to make posts {title, body, data, author}
- allow logged in users to toggle emoji-react to a post (not more than one of the same emoji per user per post though)
- allow anyone to view all posts, sorted by date, with emoji reaction counts per emoji
- allow post author to delete post

All of this in a single page with the posts, and a new post/draft thing on top, keep the login/logout section in a modal triggered by a button in top right corner, or when an login-required action (like clicking Post, or emoji) is attempted. Also have nice clean small header with app title.
